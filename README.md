# Technical exercise

### Create a Java program that simulates an online shopping system using OOP principles. The program should have the following classes:

1. Product: Represents a product available for purchase, with attributes such as name, price and quantity. The Product class should have appropriate constructors and getter/setter methods;

2. Book: Represents a specific type of product. The Book class should have additional attributes specific to books, such as author and genre. It should also have appropriate constructors and getter/setter methods;

3. Electronics: Represents another type of product. The Electronics class should have additional attributes specific to electronics, such as brand and model. It should also have appropriate constructors and getter/setter methods;

4. ShoppingCart: Represents the shopping cart where products can be added and displayed. The ShoppingCart class should have methods to add a product, calculate the total price of all products, and display the contents of the shopping cart;

5. Main: The main class that contains the main method. It should create an instance of the ShoppingCart class, add products of different types (books and electronics) to the shopping cart, calculate the total price of the products in the shopping cart, and display the contents of the shopping cart.

### Instructions:

1. Implement the Product class with the necessary attributes and methods;

2. Implement the Book class, with the necessary additional attributes and methods;

3. Implement the Electronics class, with the necessary additional attributes and methods;

4. Implement the ShoppingCart class with the necessary attributes and methods;

5. In the main method of the Main class, create an instance of the ShoppingCart class;

6. Add products of different types (books and electronics) to the shopping cart using appropriate methods;

7. Calculate the total price of the products in the shopping cart using the appropriate method;

8. Display the contents of the shopping cart using the appropriate method.
